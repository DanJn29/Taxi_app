# Vehicle Detection Test Plan

## Current Implementation Summary

### 1. Vehicle API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/vehicles` with Authorization header
- **Response Handling**: Flexible parsing for multiple formats:
  - Wrapped format: `{"vehicle": {...}}` or `{"data": {...}}`
  - Direct format: `{"id":1,"brand":"Toyota",...}`

### 2. Vehicle Detection Logic
- **Function**: `checkDriverHasVehicleRecord()` in TaxiViewModel
- **Checks**: Makes API call and returns boolean based on response
- **Fallback**: Multiple parsing strategies for different API response structures

### 3. Add Trip Button Flow
- **DriverDashboardScreen**: Enhanced Add Trip button with vehicle validation
- **Logic**: 
  ```kotlin
  if (driverVehicle != null) {
      onAddTrip() // Navigate to AddTripScreen
  } else {
      onShowMessage("Please register your vehicle first to create trips")
  }
  ```

### 4. Data Flow
1. **Login**: Driver logs in → `checkDriverHasVehicleRecord()` called
2. **Has Vehicle**: Calls `loadDriverVehicle()` → navigates to DriverDashboard
3. **No Vehicle**: Navigates to DriverVehicleSetup
4. **Dashboard Navigation**: Auto-reloads vehicle data via `navigateToScreen()`

## Testing Steps

### Test Case 1: Driver with Registered Vehicle
1. Log in as driver with existing vehicle
2. Should navigate directly to DriverDashboard
3. Vehicle data should be loaded and available
4. Add Trip button should work and navigate to AddTripScreen

### Test Case 2: Driver without Vehicle
1. Log in as driver with no vehicle
2. Should navigate to DriverVehicleSetup
3. After registering vehicle, should navigate to Dashboard
4. Add Trip button should then work

### Test Case 3: API Response Format Handling
The API should handle these response formats:
- Format 1: `{"vehicle": {"id":1,"brand":"Toyota",...}}`
- Format 2: `{"data": {"id":1,"brand":"Toyota",...}}`
- Format 3: `{"id":1,"brand":"Toyota",...}` (direct)

### Test Case 4: Network Error Handling
1. With no internet connection
2. Should show appropriate error messages
3. Should not crash the app

## Expected Behavior

### Success Flow
1. ✅ Driver logs in successfully
2. ✅ Vehicle API called with proper headers
3. ✅ Vehicle data parsed correctly regardless of format
4. ✅ Dashboard shows with Add Trip button enabled
5. ✅ Add Trip button navigates to trip creation screen

### Error Flow
1. ✅ Driver with no vehicle sees vehicle setup screen
2. ✅ Driver with vehicle but API error sees appropriate message
3. ✅ Add Trip button shows message when no vehicle detected

## Recent Updates Made

1. **VehicleData Model**: Added `status`, `photo_path`, `photo_url` fields
2. **VehicleResponse Model**: Enhanced to handle multiple response formats
3. **Vehicle Detection**: Added flexible parsing for different API structures
4. **Add Trip Button**: Added vehicle validation before navigation
5. **Auto-reload**: Vehicle data refreshes when navigating to dashboard
6. **Error Handling**: Toast messages for user feedback

## Next Steps for Testing

1. Launch app on device/emulator
2. Test driver login with existing account
3. Verify vehicle detection works correctly
4. Test Add Trip button functionality
5. Verify error messages display properly
